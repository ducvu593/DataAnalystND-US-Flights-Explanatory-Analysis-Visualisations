# Explanatory Analysis and Visualisations - US Flights
This is the final project of the Udacity's "Data Analyst Nanodegree". 
The datasets under investigation contain information about all US Flights in 2008 and other years. 

The main emphasis of this project is to provide exploratory and explanatory data analysis through stunning visualisations in the form of charts, line graphs, heatmaps, etc.. 
The exploratory data analysis consists of three sections: univariate (single variable), bivariate (two variables), and multivariate (multiple variables) exploration.

In addition, a slide deck presentation is created to summarise the most interesting insights (slides.html extension). Through GitHub, this file can run normally as a HTML file (see below on how to open the HTML file).

### Quick Guide

- A concise summary of the most interesting insights: **US_Flights_Slide_Deck_Presentation_GitHub.slides.html**. Open the file and prepend the URL with the URL link shown in the last section. 
- View the comprehensive code and comments: 
    1. Open the **US_Flights_Visualisation_Exploration.ipynb** and view it straight on GitHub, or
    2. Open the **US_Flights_Visualisation_Exploration.html** and prepend the URL with the URL link shown in the last section.
- Run the code: Follow the steps in the next section using the file **US_Flights_Visualisation_Exploration.ipynb**.

### Running the Code in Jupyter Notebook 

1. Download Jupyter Notebook for example through [Anaconda-Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).
2. Open Jupyter Notebook either through the Anaconda-Navigator App or type "jupyter notebook" in the command line (this will open in a browser).
3. Select directory that contains the Jupyter Notebook file (extension ipynb).
4. Additional five large CSV files are required to be downloaded (490-690 MB each) from the [Statistical Computing
Statistical Graphics](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) website. These files are flights information for 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008.
5. Create a new directory in the current working directory (containing the Jupyter Notebook file) named "Dataset" and add the CSV files to it. 
6. Run the code from the toolbar.

### To Open the HTML File

Prepend the HTML link with https://htmlpreview.github.io/?.
